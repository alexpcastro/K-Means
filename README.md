# K-Means

For proper function, this program, kmeans.py, also needs an image titled image.png in the same directory as the program, as this image will be used for clustering.
This program can be run by simply typing the following command in the console:
python3 kmeans.py

<h2>Results</h2>

The program will open the recolored image, changing the color clusters depending on the k value set. The program also outputs to console the number of pixels in each cluster, the total number of pixels clustered, and the total SSE.
